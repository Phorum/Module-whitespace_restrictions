Module  : Whitespace Restrictions
Version : 1.0.0
Author  : Maurice Makaay

Sometimes users post messages that contain a lot of whitespace (e.g. to
build up tension before posting a punch line.) When excessive whitespace
is used, this can be terribly annoying for forum visitors

This module can be used to restrict the use of whitespace in messages.
It will trim down the whitespace at formatting time to the limit as
configured in the module settings.

Install:
--------

- Unpack the archive;

- Move the directory "whitespace_restrictions" to the directory "mods"
  within your Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "Whitespace Restrictions". 

- Edit the settings for the module to setup the restriction that
  you want to use for your Phorum installation.
